Interstellar Spaceship Concept - Project Hephaestus
===================================================

The projects name should be *Hephaestus* after the greek god of blacksmiths and craftsmen. It would be a fitting name since any interstellar project will require all of our knowledge and craftsmanship, but despite this effort the result will be a very slow and tedious journey. 

Scope
-----

The scope of this project is to design a *manned* ship for *interstellar* voyages based on *current technologies*.
This limits us already to a single propulsion system:
- nuclear pulse propulsion, a.k.a. project Orion, a.k.a. "throw nuclear bombs behind you and ride the shockwave"
  
In turn this limits the achievable speeds to a low percantage of the speed of light
- 0.1% - 10$ of c
  
Based on the closest possible target (Proxima Centauri) at 4.2 ly and the most optimistic assumption for attainable velocity of 10% c, we get an absolute minimal travel time of 42 years, or 2 generations. Depending on our assumptions and choices we will have to deal with
- traveltimes of 40 - 400 years  (2 to 20 generations)
  
Our ship therefore has necessarily to be designed as an multi-generation ark which in turn gives us constraints on
- population size: 50 - 5000 humans
  
As well as the mass needed to sustains that population for the involved timescales:
- minimal mass of 100.000t - 1.000.000t
