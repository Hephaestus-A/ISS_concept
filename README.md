Interstellar Spaceship Concept - Project Hephaestus
===================================================

The projects name should be *Hephaestus* after the greek god of blacksmiths and craftsmen. It would be a fitting name since any interstellar project will require all of our knowledge and craftsmanship, but despite this effort the result will be a very slow and tedious journey. 

Scope
-----

The scope of this project is to design a *manned* ship for *interstellar* voyages based on *current technologies*.
This limits us already to a single propulsion system:
- nuclear pulse propulsion, a.k.a. project Orion, a.k.a. "throw nuclear bombs behind you and ride the shockwave"
  
In turn this limits the achievable speeds to a low percantage of the speed of light
- 0.1% - 10$ of c
  
Based on the closest possible target (Proxima Centauri) at 4.2 ly and the most optimistic assumption for attainable velocity of 10% c, we get an absolute minimal travel time of 42 years, or 2 generations. Depending on our assumptions and choices we will have to deal with
- traveltimes of 40 - 400 years  (2 to 20 generations)
  
Our ship therefore has necessarily to be designed as an multi-generation ark which in turn gives us constraints on
- population size: 50 - 5000 humans
  
As well as the mass needed to sustains that population for the involved timescales:
- minimal mass of 100.000t - >1.000.000t (1 to >10 aircraft carriers)


 Content
 -------


This document will contain a detailed description of one specific design and it will include considerations regarding:
- potential target systems
- colonisation in target system
- propulsion system
- artifical gravity
- food, water and air sustainability
- habitation and psychology
- ecology
- political model
- economic model
- genetic variability
- genetic modifications
- education
- sociology and cultural implications

under /tools will be a variety of python scripts to calculate ship characteristics based on different constraints and assumptions.

under /model will be a 3D model of the final design

Artificial Gravity

Genetic Moifications
====================

One of the primary obstacles when talking about interstellar (or even interplanetary) flight is radiation shielding.
We propose that the crew a(and its descendands) as well as all higher lifeforms on bord will be genetically modified to sport enhanced DNA-Repair mechanisms. 

While we those modifications are a necessity we can also consider a range of further modifications:
- the ability to produce Vitamin C was lost for primates, while there shuld be enough Vitamin C available during flight time and aditional safety net would be to 'fix' this potential problem.
- there is ony neglegible selection pressure for ailments of old age: we do know that some individuals keep physically and mentally fit into old age, while the abilitys of other diminish repidly. Its almost certain that there is a genetic component to it.
- In habitats of small size (Islands, Mountains) we observe both Island-Gigantism as well as dwarfism. By iartificially introducing dwarfism we can reduce the amount of ressources needed per person/lifeform and allow for larger populations.  


Habitation 
==========

In many depictions of space habitats the living area is imagened as a suburban landscape: lush gardens with single family homes dispersed through the landscape. This is most likely due to a perceived notion of utopia of by us-american authors.
However, this would be the most inefficient use of living space, ressources and services. A more realistic picture would concentrate all inhabitants in one or two cities or villages with the remaining uninhabitat areas usable for agriculture and recreation.
Since food production will be done in highly efficient hydroponic farms, completly seperated from the habitation areas, this leaves the remaining spaces as a back-up system of last resort for food production, and otherwise as a psychological important nature space,.

There are a handfull of concept we are culturally used to that would not transfer into to the ship. To give two examples: for more than a century we are used to the idea of having an indoor toilett as part of any flat., as well as indoor bathrooms.
Much of the required plumbing could be reduced if the inhabitants use comunal washing houses and toiletts. 

Even more important might be cooking areas: individual stoves are always a fire hazard, even if all cooking is done using induction fields. Every year xxxx homes burn down due to overheating of oil. This risk could be greatly reduced if any heating device capable of heating anything to more than 60 C is restricted to special fire resistant buildings. 

Culturally this might seem strange to the modern eye, however we should remember that outhouses used to be a common thing, shared bathrooms per etage used to be standard in many cities until xxxxx, and comunal bathrooms and toilets were a fact of living in ancient civilizations. In many villages it is still common to have a shared baking-house.
